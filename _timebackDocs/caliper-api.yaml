    ## Overview


    The Alpha Caliper API is a service that receives, validates, and processes
    learning events conforming to the [IMS Caliper Analytics®
    specification](https://www.imsglobal.org/spec/caliper/v1p2). 

    This API enables educational technology platforms to track and analyze
    student engagement, learning activities, and assessment outcomes.


    ## Key Features


    - **Event Validation**: Ensures all submitted events conform to the Caliper
    Analytics specification

    - **Event Processing**: Processes and stores valid events for analytics

    - **Multiple Event Profiles**: Supports various Caliper event profiles


    ## Getting Started


    To use this API, you need to:


    1. **Familiarize with Caliper**: Understand the [IMS Caliper Analytics
    specification](https://www.imsglobal.org/spec/caliper/v1p2)

    2. **Format Your Events**: Structure your events according to the Caliper
    data model

    3. **Submit Events**: Send events to our API endpoints wrapped in a Caliper
    envelope

    # Frequently Asked Questions



    ## Purpose of the API


    Q: **What is the purpose of the Alpha Caliper API?**


    A: Receive, validate and store learning events conforming to the [IMS
    Caliper Analytics®
    specification](https://www.imsglobal.org/spec/caliper/v1p2).

    ## Out of scope


    Q: **What is not the (direct) purpose of the Alpha Caliper API?**


    A: 


    - Generate insights from events. (ETL)

    - Provide a learning analytics platform.

    - Provide a learning content management system.

    - Raw crud apis.

    ## Insights generation


    Q: **Does Caliper have an ETL layer to extract insights from the events
    sent?**


    A: No, caliper is only responsible for storing the events, other services
    may implement an ETL layer to extract insights from specific events.

    Caliper acts like a data warehouse, it's purpose is to store events and make
    them available for reporting and analytics.

    ## Specific Use-cases


    Q: **Which events should I send?**


    A: The Alpha Caliper API supports the entire Caliper specification. We also
    extended the base spec to contain specific events for the Timeback platform.


    - If you are using the Timeback platform, take a look at the section below
    for supported use-cases.

    - If your use-case is not supported, please contact us to discuss how we can
    extend the spec to support your use-case.

    - If you want your events to be processed by the Alpha Analytics API (ETL),
    you need to conform to the TimeBack Profile and it's supported events.

    # Timeback Platform Users


    ## Guide


    If you are a user of the timeback platform you may have these questions:


    - Q: **How do I give XP to my students?**

    - Q: **How do I record time spent on activities?**

    - Q: **How do I provided information about total questions, correct answers,
    etc?**


    A: Use The **Timeback Profile**, which is a profile that extends the base
    Caliper specification to support the Timeback platform.


    It contains the following events:


    - **TimebackActivityEvent** - used to record student interaction with an
    activity.

    - **TimebackTimeSpentEvent** - used to record the time spent on an activity.



    See the timeback docs for more information:

    # Authentication


    ## Guide


    Most endpoints require authentication using the `Authorization: Bearer
    <token>` header.


    The token can be obtained with:


    ```

    curl -X POST
    https://alpha-auth-production-idp.auth.us-west-2.amazoncognito.com/oauth2/token
    \

    -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \

    -d
    "grant_type=client_credentials&client_id=<your-client-id>&client_secret=<your-client-secret>"

    ```


    Use the correct IDP server depending on the environment you're using:


    - Production Server:
      https://alpha-auth-production-idp.auth.us-west-2.amazoncognito.com
    - Staging Server:
      https://alpha-auth-development-idp.auth.us-west-2.amazoncognito.com

    Reach out to the platform team to get a client/secret pair for your
    application.

        A Caliper Score represents a "raw" or unadjusted numeric score or grade
        awarded for a given assignment submission. 

        A grade book SHOULD treat the scoreGiven value as read-only and preserve
        it.

        Represents an activity event in the context of the Timeback application.


        This event is used to track the completion of an activity.   


        The object of this event is the activity context where the event was
        recorded.


        The actor of this event is the timeback user who completed the activity.


        The event requires a generated metrics attribute to work.


        For now we only support "**Completed**" as an action. In the future we
        may support other actions.

        # TimebackTimeSpentEvent


        Represents a student time spent activity in the context of an app using
        the timeback platform.


        This event is used to track the time spent and the quality of the time
        spent by a student on an activity.


        The object of this event is the activity context where the event was
        recorded.


        The actor of this event is the timeback user who spent time on the
        activity.


        The event requires a generated metrics attribute to work.


        The metrics can indicate a parent type of metric:  'active' | 'inactive'
        | 'waste'


        A subType is also included for more specific representation of the
        activity recorded.
